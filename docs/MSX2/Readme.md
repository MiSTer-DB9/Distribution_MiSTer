# MSX1/MSX2 for [MiSTer Board](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)

> [!CAUTION]
> **WIP Notice**: This core is currently in **WIP (Work in Progress)** status. Some components are still under development and may include debug outputs or experimental features. Certain functionalities may not yet work 100% as intended.

## MSX1 Core Overview
The MSX1 core is not a direct synthesis of a specific MSX computer model. Instead, it provides a **dynamically configurable hardware environment** based on a selected definition and configuration file. Each MSX model definition includes not only the hardware setup but also the corresponding **ROM binary content.**

For full functionality, the core also relies on an **extension module configuration,** which includes additional ROM binaries. This configuration is **independent of any specific MSX model**, allowing support for:
- Multiple language variants (via localized ROMs)
- Easy future expansion with new hardware extensions

The final configuration file is a **CRC32-based ROM database**, which maps known ROM checksums to their correct mapper types. This allows the core to automatically select the appropriate ROM mapper for each loaded image.

## Supported MSX Models
[The following MSX computer models are currently supported by the MSX1 core through configuration definitions](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/MSX1_MiSTer/blob/main/ComputersModel.md)

## Supported ROM Mappers
The MSX1 core supports the following ROM mapping types:
- `ASCII8` – ASCII 8KB mapper
- `ASCII16` – ASCII 16KB mapper
- `RTYPE` – R-Type mapper
- `CrossBlaim` – Cross Blaim specific mapper
- `generic8k` – Generic 8KB ROM mapper

## MiSTerFPGA Platform Support
The MSX1 core integrates with MiSTerFPGA and supports the following features provided by the platform:
- `Joystick input` – Direct support for MiSTer-compatible joysticks
- `Keyboard input` – Customizable key mappings through model-specific configuration definitions
- `Cassette emulation or analog input` – Support for tape loading via audio input or digital emulation
- `SDRAM support` – Utilizes external SDRAM for extended memory requirements


## Creating Configurations for Computer Models and Expansion Modules
To generate configurations for MSX models and expansion modules, follow these steps:
1. Ensure **Python 3** is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the tools/CreateMSXpack directory in this project.
3. Prepare a directory containing the required ROM binary files. By default, this directory is named ROM.
4. To create a configuration for MSX computers, run: ```python3 createComp.py```  
Use `python3 createComp.py --help` to see options for specifying custom paths.
5. To create a configuration for expansion modules, run: ```python3 createDev.py```  
6. Place the resulting .MSX configuration files into your MiSTer at: `/media/fat/games/MSX1/`
